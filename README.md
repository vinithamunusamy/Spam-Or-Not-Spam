# Spam-Or-Not-Spam
This project is about classifying whether a given message (email, SMS, or text) is spam or not spam. Spam messages are unwanted, often promotional or fraudulent messages that are automatically sent to many people. Non-spam (also called ham) messages are genuine and useful communications.
